abstract: "
We present numerical simulations, based on a CFD–DEM approach, of the transport and settlement of
proppant in a planar vertical cell that mimics a hydraulic fracture. These simulations, with
resolution at the particle level, allow for a clean measurement of the dune placement and proppant
degree of mixing. The effect of the position of the injection points is considered by three
different injection heights in the vertical cell. Different proppant injection strategies were also
considered by using two different proppant types that can be injected in different orders or
simultaneously as a mixture. We evaluate the position and shape of the settled dune. We measure
the degree of mixing of the two proppant types by using the concept of mixing entropy. We have
found that an injection point placed close to the bottom of the cell leads to a dune close to the
injection points, and that an injection point at the middle or at the top of the cell leads to a
rather flat dune. Injecting different proppant types in different orders yields distinctive
proppant distributions. This helps in evaluating the benefits of positioning perforation clusters
close to geological boundaries that favor fracture growth in the upward or downward direction as
well as selecting the order of proppant mesh injection. All the simulations correspond to the
early stage, before the \"traction carpet\" effect comes into play.
