##### Pressure profiles during the discharge of a silo (PresentaciÃ³n Oral)


Christophe Perge, Juan Pablo Peralta, MarÃ­a Alejandra Aguirre, Paula Alejandra Gago, Luis A. Pugnaloni and Jean-Christophe GÃ©minard.


We analyze the evolution of the pressure profile in the outlet plane of a discharging silo for different initial conditions using two types of filling processes. The cylindrical silo (internal diameter Dc = 51.1mm) made of Plexiglas consists of two mechanically independent parts: the lateral wall (height H = 80 cm) and the outlet plane. The vertical force necessary to sustain the cylinder is measured by means of two force sensors which hold the lateral wall from the top. The outlet plane is designed to measure the profile of the vertical force applied to it. It consists of an outer ring sustained by a fixed table and an inner ring supported by two force sensors which measure the vertical force applied to it. A conical aperture (the outlet) is pierced at the center of the inner ring and we used two aperture diameters in the outlet plane A = 5 mm or A = 10 mm. In order to obtain the force profile, we used two sets of pair of rings (inner and outer ring) presenting 9 equally spaced values Sn (n ranging from 1 to 9) of the surface area S, from the 11 Profiles are measured in systems obtained with two different filling processes: 1) from the top and center part of the silo grains are poured in a jet which spreads over the base forming a pile which gets more uniform as it increases its height. 2) from the top of the silo grains are released over successive grids obtaining a ârainâ of grains over the base leading to an uniform free surface from the beginning. These filling processes lead to systems with different packing fraction which seem to influence the pressure profiles. The packing fraction is larger and more homogeneous in the rain type of filling than in the jet type of filling, which leads to pressure profiles more uniform than in the jet type of filling where the pressure exhibits a minimum at the center similar to the one observed in pressure profiles at the base of a static granular pile. In both cases pressure profile reveal a significant decrease in pressure in the vicinity of the outlet as the system discharges, whereas the flow rate remains constant. It was already known that the flow rate does not depend on the apparent mass (i.e., on the average pressure in the outlet plane). Our measurements indicate that the flow rate does not depend on the local pressure in the outlet region, identified with the vertical local stress in the outlet plane. Therefore the measurements are a direct experimental proof that the flow rates of granular material through an aperture are not controlled by the local stress conditions.

##### Universal response of granular damping devices (PresentaciÃ³n Oral)




MartÃ­n SÃ¡nchez, Gustavo Rosenthal, Luis A. Pugnaloni




Granular damping devices constitute an emerging technology for the attenuation of vibrations based on the dissipative nature of particle collisions. We show that the performance of such devices is independent of the material properties of the particles for most working conditions. Even the suppression of a dissipation mode (collisional or frictional) is unable to alter the response. We explain this phenomenon in terms of the inelastic collapse of granular materials. These findings provide a crucial standpoint for the design of such devices in order to achieve the desired low maintenance feature that makes particle dampers particularly suitable to harsh environments.





##### Arches and contact forces in a granular pile (Poster)




C. Manuel. Carlevaro, Luis A. Pugnaloni




Assemblies of granular particles mechanically stable under their own weight contain arches. These are structural units identified as sets of mutually stable grains. It is generally assumed that these arches shield the weight above them and should bear most of the stress in the system. We test such hypothesis by studying the stress born by in-arch and out-of-arch grains. We show that, indeed, particles in arches withstand larger stresses. In particular, the isotropic stress tends to be larger for in-arch grains whereas the anisotropic component is marginally distinguishable between the two types of particles. The contact force distributions demonstrate that an exponential tail (compatible with the maximization of entropy under no extra constraints) is followed only by the out-of-arch contacts. In-arch contacts seem to be compatible with a Gaussian distribution consistent with a recently introduced approach that takes into account constraints imposed by the local force balance on grains.
